CS3217 Problem Set 5
====================

**Name:** Huang Lie Jun

**Matric No:** A0123994W

**Tutor:** Irvin Lim

Tips
----
1.  CS3217's Gitbook is at <https://www.gitbook.com/book/cs3217/problem-sets/details>. Do visit the Gitbook often, as it contains all things relevant to CS3217. You can also ask questions related to CS3217 there.
2.  Take a look at `.gitignore`. It contains rules that ignores the changes in certain files when committing an Xcode project to revision control. (This is taken from <https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Swift.gitignore>).
3.  A Swiftlint configuration file is provided for you. It is recommended for you to use Swiftlint and follow this configuration. Keep in mind that, ultimately, this tool is only a guideline; some exceptions may be made as long as code quality is not compromised.
4.  Do not burn out. Have fun!


Rules of Your Game
------------------
> **Rules** &nbsp; `0 points`
>
> Describe the rules of your game and how the game works in a file called README.md. Although the rules are not graded, it gives the players (which includes your tutors) expectations on how the game is supposed to behave, so as to distinguish between features and bugs.

Problem 1: Cannon Direction
---------------------------
(write something here)

> **Question 1** &nbsp; `5 points`
>
> Explain in README.md how the user is supposed to select the cannon direction.

(your answer here)


Problem 2: Upcoming Bubbles
---------------------------
(write something here)

> **Question 2** &nbsp; `5 points`
>
> It will be helpful for the user if they are given the colors of the next few bubbles to better plan their shots. Your task is to come up with an algorithm to decide on the colors of the next few bubbles and justify it in README.md.

Problem 3: Integration
----------------------
(write something here)

> **Question 3** &nbsp; `10 points`
>
> Describe in the file README.md how your design allowed the integration of the game engine. Explain the advantages and disadvantages of your approach and alternative approaches.

Problem 4: Special Bubbles
--------------------------
(write something here)

### Problem 4.4
> **Question 4.4** &nbsp; `5 points`
>
> Explain in the file README.md your general strategy for implementing these special bubble behaviours and support for chaining activation. Explain why your strategy is the best among alternatives.

Problem 5: Additional Game Features
-----------------------------------
(write something here)


Problem 6: Game Flow
--------------------
(write something here)


Problem 7: Class Diagram
------------------------
> **Question 7** &nbsp; `20 points`
>
> Draw the class diagram for the basic implementation of your game (i.e. you do not need to include the bells and whistles). Save your diagram as class-diagram.png and include it in the root directory of your repository for submission. Also give descriptions of the high-level purposes of the important classes in the README.md file. If you would like to add more diagrams that you find helpful in allowing others to understand your code architecture, feel free to add them in, and indicate it inside README.md.

(Please save your diagram as `class-diagram.png` in the root directory of the repository.)

Problem 8: Testing
------------------
> **Question 8** &nbsp; `40 points`
>
> Please describe your testing strategy in README.md. The testing strategy should also include the testing strategies for Problem Sets 3 and 4, since these are components of the final application. If you did your testing perfectly in the previous problem sets, you only need to replicate what you did earlier; if you didn't do so well, this is where you show that you've learnt something and update the tests.

Problem 9: Bells and Whistles
------------------
> **Question 9** &nbsp; `75 points`
>
> You are free to add your own features to show off your creativity. Please describe ALL the extra features and improvements in the file README.md, so that your tutors can award you due credit. Briefly describe how you modified your original design to implement each feature. Be creative in this section! You may make use of Markdown formatting features to include diagrams and screenshots to better illustrate your point.
>
> You are allowed to use external resources (images and sound) to implement these, but please adhere to any licensing requirement and credit the original creators in the README.md file.

Problem 10: Final Reflection
------------------
> **Question 10** &nbsp; `10 points`
>
> Comment on the original design of your MVC architecture and also on the design of your game engine. Is it possible to further improve the design/architecture? If so, how? If not, why not?
